# Suggested Mods for the Create SMP (2026)

**#1: Create: Copycats+**
Adds in a ton of unique block shapes which can be retextured into any block face. Similar to the pre-existing Copycat Panel & Copycat Step found in the vanilla create mod.

**#2: Farmer's Delights**
Adds a lot of new food choices. This is good for less technical and technical players alike, providing new items and resources to create for the non-technical, and new items to automate and produce for the technical. On top of this, it adds decorational blocks, which are excellent for building. (For instance, [Food Crates](https://www.minecraft-guides.com/wiki/farmers-delight/storage/crate/)

**#3: Comforts**
Adds sleeping bags and hammocks. Sleeping bags are used as beds whilst exploring, which avoids destroying your spawn point. Hammocks are used to skip to night.

**#4: Chipped, #5: Rechisled, #6: Rechisled: Create**
All 3 of these mods add in additional block textures for a variety of blocks. Only useful for building, but are a great addition for texturing.

**#7: Immersive Aircraft, #8: Man of Many Planes**
Adds a variety of planes and airships, useful for traversing the land. (Though, I do believe these are slower than trains). The second mod adds more planes to Immersive Aircraft but with create recipes in mind, often requiring Mechanical Crafters for larger recipes.

**#9: Create: Interiors**
Literally just adds better seats based on the Create mod seats for usage in trains.

**#10: Create Deco**
Decorative blocks designed for Create mod factories.

**#11: Create Railway Navigator**
Okay, this one is cool as fuck. Adds in a full on Transport Navigator inspired by Germany's real-life DB Navigator to provide players with real-time information about their trains, and how to navigate from one location to another. Also adds some functioning displays for Train Stations and on-board trains themselves.

**#12: Factory Blocks**
Just decorative blocks designed for factory environments. Does require Chipped.

That's all I've got that would work with this style of SMP. :)
